# ðŸš¢ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains an end-to-end ML solution for the classic Titanic dataset using:

- ðŸŽ¯ **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting model.
- ðŸ”¬ **TabM (Tabular MLP)**: A neural network model optimized with Optuna.
-   **Note:** This project also serves as a test to evaluate the performance and integration of the TabM (Tabular MLP) model architecture.

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

| Model     | Validation Accuracy | 5-Fold CV Accuracy |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| XGBoost   | 80.45%              | 81.48% Â± 2.66%     |
| TabM      | **83.80%**          | *(TBD)*            |
